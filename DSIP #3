#1 How many public high schools are in each zip code? in each state?

-- Each Zip Code

select zip_code, count(*) as schools from publichsdata
group by zip_code
order by count(*) desc

-- Each State

select state_code, count(*) as schools from publichsdata
group by state_code
order by count(*) desc

#2 The locale_code column in the high school data corresponds to various levels of urbanization as listed below. Use the CASE statement to display the corresponding locale_text and locale_size in your query result.

select school_name, locale_code,

	when substr(locale_code,1,1) = '1' THEN 'City'
	when substr(locale_code,1,1) = '2' then 'Suburb'
	when substr(locale_code,1,1) = '3' THEN 'Town'
	when substr(locale_code,1,1) = '4' THEN 'Rural'
END as 'urbanization',
CASE when locale_code < 24 then 
	case 
		when substr(locale_code,2,1) = '1' then 'Large'
		when substr(locale_code,2,1) = '2' then 'Midsize'
